**EcoSwap** is a green-tech platform designed to promote a circular economy by connecting individuals selling scrap materials with buyers and showcasing handicrafts made from recycled waste. Our mission is to turn waste into a valuable resource, reduce landfill, and empower local artisans.

> **Your trash is another's treasure.** This project transforms the way we think about waste by creating a single ecosystem for recycling, sustainability, and eco-friendly commerce.

## 💡 About The Project

In a world grappling with waste management, EcoSwap provides a practical solution. We've created an online marketplace with two primary goals:

1.  **For Scrap:** To provide a simple, profitable way for households and businesses to sell their scrap materials (metal, plastic, paper, e-waste) directly to recycling units, artists, and industries.
2.  **For Handicrafts:** To offer a dedicated platform for local artisans and small businesses to sell beautiful, sustainable products made from recycled materials.

This creates a self-sustaining loop: **Waste → Resource → Product → Market**, which has a powerful triple impact:
* **Environmental:** Reduces landfill waste and promotes conscious recycling.
* **Social:** Empowers local artisans and creates a new income stream.
* **Economic:** Turns discarded materials into a valuable commodity.
