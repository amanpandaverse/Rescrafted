## 💡 About The Project

In a world grappling with waste management, EcoSwap provides a practical solution. This frontend project builds the user-facing side of an online marketplace with two primary goals:

1.  **For Scrap:** To provide a simple, profitable way for households and businesses to sell their scrap materials (metal, plastic, paper, e-waste).
2.  **For Handicrafts:** To offer a dedicated platform for local artisans and small businesses to sell beautiful, sustainable products made from recycled materials.

This interface is the first step in creating a self-sustaining loop: **Waste → Resource → Product → Market**.
